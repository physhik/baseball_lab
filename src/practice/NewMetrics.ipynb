    "### Fielding independent pitching stat\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "FIP (fielding independent pitching) could be one of most famous pitching stats in recent 10 years. So intuitive and not too hard to calculate.\n",
    "\n",
    "FIP formula has a constant term about 3.2 (varying up to the league ERA).\n",
    "\n",
    "If I remember correctly, the constant comes from the bip and was suggested to be a fixed number because our understanding to batted ball was still unclear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statcast now provides many good informations of the batted balls. Thus, we would want to really fielding independent pitching stats finally by using xwOBAcon or some other statcast stats else. I used xwOBAcon and rescaled the constant term to league ERA. You can see the formula at a python file in the Github repo. I temporarily named it nFIP in my project files.\n",
    "\n",
    "HR is also dependent on the environments such as the stadium, weathers, so we want to use barrels instead of HR as the represtative of the well-crushed hit. I named it xnFIP in my project files.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the motives of this project is that FIP underestimates ground ball pitchers and the constant term about 3.2 is too big. Of course, strikeouts are really good. However, how do we estimate the value of weakly contacted ball in WAR?\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2nd motive is ... if you check the variance of ERA of the players in the league compared to that of FIP. FIP's variance is much smaller. And the variances of xFIP, SIERA are much much smaller. That's why people thought FIP, xFIP, SIERA have some predictive potential. However, those stats just predict less boldly, and that's why they are wrong less to anticipate.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the fixed number 3.2 varies, the variance of nFIP become larger and nFIP still yields better correlations to next year pitching stats. I think this caused by good property of the new stats to put the value in weak contacts. There are so much room to be adjusted in the stats, but hope this is a right direction to evaluate pitchers' ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also want to discuss if rescaling FIP to ERA makes sense. Why not RA? I want to call it rFIP here, and made derivatives too. I prefer R because ER is influenced by error more than R. I wanted to avoid the situatioin HR, SO, BB are included only to FIP, not to ERA because of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "About xFIP, I think giving the same HR rate to the fly balls is rather old fashioned since the fly ball exit velocities have been measured.\n",
